Problem Definition: Unveiling the Virtual Classroom: An In-Depth Analysis of The Online Education System
Business requirements for a problem statement like this would include taking student and teacher surveys, understanding student needs, and having an efficient feedback system. There is a need to update the content that is being taught to students based on the feedback. These requirements are necessary to ensure that students are able to find it easy to adjust with online education / e-learning. Specific requirements may vary depending on the student demographic, their needs and their interests.
A literature survey for online education would involve reviewing existing research on topics related to ed tech and student behaviour. The survey would involve defining a research question, identifying relevant sources, reading and analysing the literature, organizing and summarizing the literature, identifying gaps in the literature, and providing recommendations for e-learning/online education based on the findings. The goal of the literature survey is to understand the current state of knowledge on a topic and to
identify areas where further research is needed. It also helps to build upon the existing knowledge and avoid duplication of effort.

Social Impact: Understanding the pros and cons of e-learning and making it better for future generations.
Business Model/Impact: Ed-tech companies and other organizations can capitalize on this.
